Make sure you have set up the development environment first. You can read it here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.

How to run:

Run "npm install", if there are any issues, then run "npm install --legacy-peer-deps". Once that is done, ensure that your device is detected. You can check by running "adb devices". If it's detected, you can run "npm run android".
